Hi, I’m Sun Woo Kim, a PhD student in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University under the supervision of [Professor Xue Bin (Jason) Peng](https://xbpeng.github.io/). Before joining SFU, I studied at POSTECH and later earned my master’s degree from Seoul National University under the guidance of [Professor Jehee Lee](https://mrl.snu.ac.kr/~jehee/). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Professor Sehoon Ha](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/) on projects related to adaptive robot behavior. After graduation, I fulfilled my military service as a Technical Research Personnel at NCSOFT. There, I worked in the Graphics AI Lab on gesture-driven animation for virtual agents. After the lab was spun off as NC AI, my work focused on motion retrieval and generation.

Across these stages, my focus has steadily converged on one question: how can robots move in ways that feel less like machines and more like companions? I believe that for robots to become true collaborators in our lives, their movements must carry clarity, intention, and a trace of humanity. My research lies at the intersection of robotics and computer animation, where I design motion that is not only mechanically correct, but also expressive and intuitive.
