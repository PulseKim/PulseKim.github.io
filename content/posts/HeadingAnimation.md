### About
This project is done by Sunwoo Kim, Junghoon Kong, Dongwon Son for the final project of the lecture "Advanced Computer Animation", 2019. This project aim to show the different style of football headers especially water-ball header inspired by the comedy show "Infinite Challenge". When a player hits the normal ball(soft ball) with his head, he can normally complete the header motion, bouncing back the ball. However, when he hits the water-filled-ball(heavy ball), he shows comedic falling motion while the ball just plungeing to the ground.
