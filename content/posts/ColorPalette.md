### About
To improve the other programs that extract the color palette from the image, our program serve clearly representative color sets with dominant/assort/accent color presented. Furthermore, our system serves extraction from the video. Our algorithm is based on the clustering and distance based merging system which uses domain knowledge of color-study. Furthermore our algorithm is combined with body inferring technique for obtaining representation color with more saliency.
