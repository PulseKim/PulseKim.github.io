### About
This project is done by Sunwoo Kim, Hyukyu Kang, and Dayoung Lee for the final project of the lecture "Computer Graphics". We aim to make the "Harry Potter Chess" which the player is located on a selected chess piece. In that sense, the view of the camera is attached to the selected piece. The rule is based on the real chess and the special rule is added. The special rule gives the victory to a player when he catches the player-on-piece of opponent.
