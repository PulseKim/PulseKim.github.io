Sunwoo Kim is a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University(SNU) advised by Professor [Jehee Lee](https://mrl.snu.ac.kr/~jehee/). Also, unofficially I was co-advised by Professor [Sehoon Ha](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/) since 2020. I received a B.Sc from the Pohang University of Science and Technology. My current research interest lies on connecting computer animation to the robotics. I like thinking a new idea and bring it to real world.
