## About Me

Hi, I’m Sun Woo Kim — a PhD student in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University, where I work in the [GrUVi Lab](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca/) under the supervision of [Jason Peng](https://xbpeng.github.io/). Before joining SFU, I studied at POSTECH and later earned my master’s degree from Seoul National University under the guidance of [Professor Jehee Lee](https://mrl.snu.ac.kr/~jehee/). I’ve also had the chance to collaborate with [Professor Sehoon Ha](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/) on projects related to adaptive robot behavior. Most recently, I worked as a researcher at NC AI’s Graphics AI Lab, leading projects on body-gesture generation for virtual agents.

Across these stages, my focus has steadily converged on one question: how can robots move in ways that feel less like machines and more like companions? I believe that for robots to become true collaborators in our lives, their movements must carry clarity, intention, and a trace of humanity. My research lies at the intersection of robotics and computer animation, where I design motion that is not only mechanically correct, but also expressive and intuitive. By borrowing from the language of animation and applying it to embodied agents, I aim to shape robotic motion that communicates — gestures that signal intent, movements that feel alive.
