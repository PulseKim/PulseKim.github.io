## About Me

Hi, I’m Sunwoo Kim — a researcher at the Graphics AI Lab at NC Research, where I explore how robots can move more like companions than machines.

I believe that one day, robots won’t just be tools — they’ll be general-purpose allies: helpers, collaborators, even friends. But to truly integrate into our lives, they need to move with clarity, intention, and a touch of humanity. That’s why my research sits at the intersection of robotics and computer animation, where I design motion that feels intuitive and expressive — not just mechanically correct.

My academic path began at POSTECH, and I later received my master’s from Seoul National University under the guidance of [Professor Jehee Lee](https://mrl.snu.ac.kr/~jehee/). I’ve also had the chance to collaborate with [Professor Sehoon Ha](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~sha9/) on projects related to adaptive robot behavior.

I'm passionate about shaping robotic motion that communicates — gestures that imply intent, movements that feel alive. To do that, I often borrow from the language of animation and apply it to the physical world. That fusion of graphics and robotics continues to drive my work today.
